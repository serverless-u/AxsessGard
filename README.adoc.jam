= AxsessGard (AxG)

== Description
AxsessGard (AxG) is a REST application backed by a JPA database that manages access control lists. It provides a JWT-based authorization system for client-server interactions. AxG is designed to work in conjunction with third-party applications to provide fine-grained access control.

== Current Status
AxG is currently a work in progress. This README provides an overview of the core concepts and functionality. Installation guides and more detailed documentation will be available in future releases.

== Technology Stack
- Kotlin
- Spring Boot
- JPA (Java Persistence API)

== Features
- JWT-based authorization
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Policy-based permissions
- Integration with existing application servers
- Database-agnostic (supports any database compatible with JPA)

== How It Works
1. A client requests access to a resource from a third-party application server.
2. The application server authenticates the user (AxG does not handle authentication).
3. The application server creates a signed JWT containing:
- User ID
- Policy ID controlling access to the resource
- List of user roles
4. The application server directs the client to AxG for authorization.
5. AxG verifies the JWT signature and checks the provided information against its database.
6. AxG issues a signed JWT containing all actions the user is allowed to perform.
7. The client can use this JWT to access permitted resources on the application server.

== API Reference
AxG provides a single endpoint:
- **GET** request
- The Authorization header should contain the JWT from the third-party application

== Configuration
Minimal configuration is required. Third-party applications need to be onboarded so that their public keys are known to AxG for JWT verification.

== Security Considerations
- All JWTs in the system are signed, including AxG's responses.
- AxG does not handle user authentication; this responsibility lies with the third-party application.

== Future Plans
- Token expiration features
- Additional documentation, including installation guides
- Performance optimizations
